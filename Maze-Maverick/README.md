## Some info about the game:

### About Accounts:
*   At first have to sing in to you're account or create an account.
*   You can choose whether you want the game to remember you for a week or not.
*   If you choose sing out the game will forget you're username and password so the next time you run the game you have to sing in manualy.
*   Username can't be empty and you have to set a password for your account.
*   All usernames and password are protected by a strong hash function.

### Main Menu:
After you entered to you're account you'll see the menu with many items.
If you want to select one of them you can write the item's number and press enter the key to select it.
If you want to choose any item first select it and then press the enter key.

### About Generating A Maze:

*   You're parameters are have to be valid 
*   There is no gaurantee that mazes that are created manualy have a soloution
*   For generating a maze by random generator if it takes more than 15 seconds to creat by random generator it probably doesn't have any existing solution
    
### About ranting changes:
*   If you solve it: ((n + m) * l) / (Time taken to solve(min) + 1)
*   If you can't solve the maze and bot can solve this under 15 seconds : -50
*   If you can't solve the maze and bot can't solve this under 15 seconds : 0


### About Chess (Just for fun):
It's a chess game just like real chess game.

### Other things:
This game is userfriendly enough and I don't think any thing remain.

-------------

Enjoy it!
